		<h2>Mod III Software and Quality Assurance</h2>
		<p class="font">
			As mentioned before, Mod III allows participants to learn more about their desired track. In the Software testing and Quality Assurance training, there have been many major topics mentioned to help develop each student for their internship.</p>
			<h3>White box testing</h3>
		<p class="font">	
			White box testing is when the tester has access to the code and can examine it during testing.The tester knows exactly how the product does what it does. It can also be known as glass box testing or clear box testing because of the transparency of the testing. The tester looks at the ins and outs of the product and code.</p>
			<h3>Black box testing</h3>
		<p class="font">
			Black box testing is testing without knowledge of the code. The testing is functional or behavioral; it is done by using the product the way a user would. Testing what the product does, without knowing how it does it.</p> 
			<h3>Static Testing</h3>
		<p class="font">
			Static testing consists of testing something that is not currently running. Being able to examine and review a non-operational product by just looking at it. An example of static testing is examining a pair of shoes for weight and material.</p>
			<h3>Dynamic Testing</h3>
		<p class="font">	
			Dynamic testing is testing a product by using it. Being able to review a product as it is meant to be used. For example putting on a pair of shoes and walking with them to see how they feel.</p><br>
		<p class="font">	
			As shown in the diagram below, these different ways of testing can overlap with one another
